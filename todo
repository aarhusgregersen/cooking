Tasks:
- Edit and setup views for recipes
	- Add modal/lightbox popup for images
		- It is somehow lacking the id of the item it is 'lightboxing'
- Make it possible to delete images
	- Set up destroy_image action on edit page
	- Make destroy image button work
- Add an admin namespace
	- See devise guide for how to add admins.
- Add an admin through seeds
- Seed database
	- Might use faker gem for this
- Create a related table authorDetails
- Style front(blog_posts) page
- Style 'show user' site
- Add to author.rb has_one author detail with destroy dependency
- Remove edit link in title for blog and recipe
	- Check for admin status to allow edits
	- if blog post / recipe OWNED BY current_user = allow edit
- Turn code into HAML
- Add bootstrap modal as helper
	- If I'm too dumb to do that, add as partial
- Instead of not showing "new blog / recipe" when not logged in do:
	- Show greyed out links
	- use balloon.css to show hover notification that says to register
- Set up omniauth login for facebook



Goals:
- Have users and admins user groups
	- People can NOT sign up as admins
	- Both have to be authenticated and can be remembered (cookie)
-
