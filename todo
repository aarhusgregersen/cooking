- Remove edit link in title for blog and recipe
	- Check for admin status to allow edits
	- if blog post / recipe OWNED BY current_user = allow edit
- Turn code into HAML
- Add bootstrap modal as helper
	- If I'm too dumb to do that, add as partial

	- Show greyed out links
	- use balloon.css to show hover notification that says to register
- Set up omniauth login for facebook
